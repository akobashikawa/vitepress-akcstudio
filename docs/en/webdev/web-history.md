# Brief History of the Web

## Hypertext

::: info
The concept of hypertext is basically that a text can be linked to other text, and that a page can contain multimedia, rather than just text.
:::

The origin of the web dates back to the late 1980s, when [Tim Berners-Lee](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) led a project at [CERN](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizaci%C3%B3n_Europea_para_la_Investigaci%C3%B3n_Nuclear) to help the community of scientists share their publications.

The language [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) was created, with basic capabilities to format text and make **hyperlinks**, or _links_ between pages, which allowed weaving a network of documents where you could easily jump from one to the other.

This network seemed similar to a spider web and was named _World Wide Web_ (_WWW_, or _The Web_).

To navigate this network of _hypertexts_, a program called _browser_ is used, where you can go to a certain page by entering its address, or _URL_, and also jump to new addresses using the links.

::: info
[Mosaic](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic) was the first browser that allowed images to be displayed along with the text, instead of in another window.
:::

When the use of the web was liberated, it soon spread to other academic communities, universities, and throughout the world.

::: info
Tim Berners-Lee created the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium), or W3C, to generate recommendations and standards to guide the long-term growth of the web.

## Styles

Traditional media, such as newspapers and magazines, experimented with publishing on the web and promoted proposals to improve the presentation of web pages.

**style sheets** [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) appeared to allow more efficient management of the graphic design of a web page.


## Actions

Companies like **Microsoft**, with [Internet Explorer](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer), and **Netscape**, with [Navigator](https://es.wikipedia.org /wiki/Netscape_Navigator), competed to have the best browser, promoting the development of [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), a programming language to manipulate the components of a web page.

Thus, HTML, CSS and Javascript became the trio necessary to build a web page.

::: info
Internet Explorer used the term _surfing_ on the web, while Navigator said _surfing_ on the web, which is what became most popular.

Currently, browser is synonymous with browser.
:::

::: info
Due to commercial maneuvers, Internet Explorer became the default browser for Windows installations, leaving Navigator at a disadvantage to compete.

Subsequently. Netscape folded, releasing Navigator. Further development was taken over by **Mozilla** under the name **Firefox**.

Although Firefox led the way in its ability to better follow standards for handling web content and was preferred by developers, Internet Explorer maintained a dominant presence.

Finally, **Google Chrome**, which followed standards like Firefox but with better speed and performance, was quickly gaining acceptance. Although it had to be installed, compared to an always present Internet Explorer, it became the most popular browser.
