## How to read a book?

> Tell me something, I'll forget it \
> Show me it, I'll be able to remember it \
> But involve me in it and I'll understand it \
> _-- Chinese proverb_

### Tips

- Try to follow your tastes.
   - Read what pleases you.
   - It is not necessary to start at the beginning or finish at the end.

### Footer technique

- There's a technique I've found very useful.
- It consists of placing at the footer of each page a phrase that represents the main idea, or the main ideas.
- This way, when you pick up the book, you can quickly review it by reading those footers.
- But the greatest utility comes from the effort of writing those phrases.
  - It's not about underlining or copying the most relevant text.
  - It's about expressing in your own words what that page says.
  - And, by doing so, you engage with it, you understand it.

### How to read an ebook?

- One way to adapt the footer technique is to use the annotation tools provided by the reading application.
- Another way is to make annotations in an independent medium.
  - For example, a system like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
  - Or, publishing it on a web page, like this.
